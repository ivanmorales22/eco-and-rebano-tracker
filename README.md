# Problem Statement
Living in guadalajara is amazing, going into some news sites and scrolling trough all of the clickbait to read the concise information at the end of it, is not, at the same time, monitoring local sustainability metrics like the level of Chapala Lake requires digging trough unfriendly government websites, this only creates friction for one to stay informed efficiently about two topics that I am passionate about, Chivas and Sustainability.

The solution comes with a bot that gathers the info, and displays it on a Streamlit Dashboard sending you a brief email every day to wake up informed.
